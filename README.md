# divRolodex
overlapping html div rolodex kind of thingy

This script creates a bunch of overlapping divs that switch when the mouse hovers near the top or bottom edge of the "card".

Seems simple but was hard to code correctly and get the Z Indices to work out.

An alternative method to view a sequence of images instead of thumbnails.
